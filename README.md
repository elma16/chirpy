# UST_Project

The modularized version of the project is organized under the FullWaveUST package. Documentation for the three-layer structure is provided in the doc folder and will continue to be updated.

The files MultiFrequencyWaveformInvkWave.py and the function folder contain the original code, which was translated from the initial version of this project into Python. The main.py file serves as the main entry point after the code was modularized.

Example data files are available under the Releases section on the right.
Please create a SampleData folder in your local project directory and place the downloaded data files there.
